RUN SUMMARY (append-only)
- Pass 1: Generated initial spec.v0.1.0 and review SR-00001.
- Pass 2 (AMD-00001 → spec.v0.1.1): encoded answered decisions and determinism tightening:
  - Storage root: ~/.netsec-sk
  - Backend: localhost ephemeral port + runtime/server.json discovery
  - Batch ingest: sequential, continue on error
  - Topology inference: CIDR overlap evidence (ignore default route)
  - RMA: user confirmation when hostname matches but serial differs
  - Added ingest/commit/runtime schemas and API contract
  - Added normative TSF extraction appendix (Appendix A)
- Pass 3 (AMD-00002 → spec.v0.1.2): added deterministic schemas for:
  - environments/<env_id>/meta.json
  - environments/<env_id>/state.json (MVP) including ordering + canonical hash rules
  - environments/<env_id>/intro.md (agent-friendly summary format)
- Pass 4 (AMD-00003 → spec.v0.1.3): completed API contracts for planning gate:
  - Added deterministic contracts for `DELETE /api/environments/{env_id}`
  - Added deterministic contracts for `GET /api/environments/{env_id}/state`
  - Added deterministic contracts for `GET /api/environments/{env_id}/commits` including ordering and unpaginated MVP stance
  - Added deterministic contracts for `POST /api/environments/{env_id}/flow-trace` including request validation and response shape

BLOCKER STATUS: UNBLOCKED (DETERMINISTIC)
- Blocking Questions: empty
- Spec Ambiguity Audit: 0 remaining ambiguities
- Decisions: all Active
