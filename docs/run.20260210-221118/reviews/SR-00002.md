# Review SR-00002 — NetSec StateKit spec.v0.1.1

## Reviewer A — Ambiguity Hunter
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- Consider adding an explicit `schema_version` for appendix mapping and a checksum in the spec to prevent drift.

### SPEC DELTAS
- Optional (future): SPEC §9.2 add `mapping_version` field in ingest record to point to Appendix A version.

---

## Reviewer B — Edge Cases & Failure Modes
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- Overlap-based adjacency can create many edges; consider future “edge suppression” rules (e.g., require both sides to have non-default route + non-null egress interface).

### SPEC DELTAS
- None required for MVP determinism.

---

## Reviewer C — Security/Privacy/Abuse Modes
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- Add rate limiting to ingest endpoints to avoid accidental DoS by repeated large uploads (local-only but still relevant).

### SPEC DELTAS
- Optional (future): SPEC §5.4 add “max concurrent requests” and “upload size cap” constraints.

---

## Reviewer D — Testability & Verification
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- Recommend adding a deterministic “golden TSF fixtures” strategy (small synthetic archives) to CI for parser unit tests.

### SPEC DELTAS
- Optional (future): SPEC §7.1 add “golden fixture” proof artifacts list.

---

## Verdict
PASS. Spec v0.1.1 encodes all previously-missing implementation-impacting decisions, provides deterministic data schemas and API shapes, and anchors extraction rules to a normative appendix.
