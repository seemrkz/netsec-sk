# Review SR-00003 — NetSec StateKit spec.v0.1.2

## Reviewer A — Ambiguity Hunter
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- Consider adding an explicit `schema_migrations.md` (future) once schema_version changes from 1.0.0.

### SPEC DELTAS
- None required.

---

## Reviewer B — Edge Cases & Failure Modes
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- `serial_history` update rules could be expanded later (e.g., if serial becomes `not_found` for an ingest). MVP is acceptable.

### SPEC DELTAS
- None required.

---

## Reviewer C — Security/Privacy/Abuse Modes
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- `intro.md` should avoid embedding large raw outputs (it currently does; good). Keep it summary-only.

### SPEC DELTAS
- None required.

---

## Reviewer D — Testability & Verification
### BLOCKERS
- None.

### NON-BLOCKERS
- Add a small CLI “validate” command later to verify canonicalization and schema locally.

### SPEC DELTAS
- None required.

---

## Verdict
PASS. The state and metadata schemas are now explicit, ordering rules are defined, and commit hashing is testable. This removes the last meaningful ambiguity for implementing a stable `state.json` for both humans and AI agents.
